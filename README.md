金鯨獎 2020, 2021, 2022, 2024 (Han Sinitic Language) ISBN: 978-0-473-72399-6 This is the second book I collaborated with my loving companion, focusing on films. We have established a rigorous selection process where we watch one chosen film each week, ensuring complete attention by eliminating distractions such as phones. This practice has exposed us to a diverse range of films e.g. from Lebanon, Lesotho, Romania, Chile, Cambodia, and more. Annually, we organise film festivals to analyse the year's films in depth (e.g. semiotics, plurality, cinematography, plot, concepts etc). and present awards to a nominated few. This process is a significant contemplative exercise, which plays a crucial role in shaping multiple dimensions of the moral functioning framework as well as helping me step out of my echo chamber.
